# hello-world
ideas and practice

Today is a really hard day. All I can think about is Whitley and how I don't know when I will ever see her again. Also Tommy and why he said he missed me but won't talk to me. It is hard to breathe. I can't stop crying. I'm never dating or doing this ever again. Fuck this noise. I'll have pets and be fine. I feel like I'm dying.
