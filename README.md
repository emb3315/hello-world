# hello-world
ideas and practice

Today is a really hard day. All I can think about is Whitley and how I don't know when I will ever see her again. Also Tommy and why he said he missed me but won't talk to me. It is hard to breathe. I can't stop crying. I'm never dating or doing this ever again. Fuck this noise. I'll have pets and be fine. I feel like I'm dying.

I journal like an insane person these days. I have written journals. I have digital journals. I have all of these journals intended to hold all of these feelings that I do not know what to do with. I wish I could just turn it off. It would be so much nicer if I could just figure out how to stop all the feelings. No more feelings please.
