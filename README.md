# hello-world
ideas and practice

Today is a really hard day. All I can think about is Whitley and how I don't know when I will ever see her again. Also Tommy and why he said he misses me but won't talk to me. It is hard to breathe. I can't stop crying. I'm never dating or doing this ever again. Fuck this noise. I'll have pets and be fine. I feel like I'm dying.

I feel like hibernating, forever. I don't feel like taking care of myself. I haven't been to the gym since he dumped me. Next week I need to start going six days a week. I will focus on myself, yoga, working out, work, coding, moving, gre prep. I will not let myself fall apart. I will not let him destroy me. I will be strong for Whitley. I will keep myself together for when I get to see her again. Even if that is seven years from now.

I will be strong for her. I will get to see her again. I have to believe that. I have to.
